# Hackathon2019
A copy of the repository used in the hackathon by Jack and myself.

This was a resource management game built with Java and the Swing library.
The goal is to reduce your CO2 footprint by unlocking things that make your everyday life less negatively impactful on the environment.

We did this project over two days (approx 10 hours) and received first place in our University Hackathon for 3rd division.
